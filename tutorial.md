# tutorial to get started

## Quick Start

A great place to start is by creating your first comment.

You can do it right here in this document by clicking one of the plus icons that you can see to the left

<-----

Each line of each script can have a comment associated with it. You can add, edit and delete these comments as you wish.

## Where am I?

To get you started I created a new workspace for you. A **workspace** is a collection of **scripts** which you have uploaded so that you can comment on them.

This is just a demo one to get you started. You can create as many workspaces as you like, so it makes sense to group scripts together in a sensible way (for instance, if you're providing comments on a particular set of scripts that someone else has written)

## What is the weird name I see?

Each workspace is given a _unique reference_ and url (eg _invisible-mottled-piculet_). You can change this to something more sensible if you want to give it a real name.

## How do I navigate between the scripts?

You can see a list of the scripts in your current workspace on the left hand side column.

You can add a new script to a workspace by clicking the "Add New" button and either uploading from a file or URL.

## Is this secure?

Nope.

Currently ANYONE with the url can edit this comment set, delete comments, change everything to profanity, insert a load of php - loads of horrible things.

To stop that happening you can create an account on the top right. That means that any future workspace you create will be locked so that only you can edit them. Once you have an account you can also claim old workspaces which aren't currently owned.

**Important note**: Workspaces, their scripts and their comments are **always** readable. So any code or comments you upload here can always be read by anyone with the URL. No nuclear codes here.
